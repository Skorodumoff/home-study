In the app I try to leverage the 
container/dumb component approach.

As my experience with Angular is primarily with 
ngrx powered projects (and 3rd party libs are not allowed)
Thus Observables in services might not be done the optimal way.
(will clean it up if I have time) 

things left to implement:

1) authorization and guards
2) adding fake message to the list
3) separate transport service for messages 
(as messageService becomes messy)
4) unit tests
5) overall cleanup
6) separate user and auth services
